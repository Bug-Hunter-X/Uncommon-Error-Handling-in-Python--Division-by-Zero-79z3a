This repository demonstrates an uncommon error handling scenario in Python, specifically addressing division by zero. The code example shows how to handle division by zero without raising an exception, returning infinity instead. This approach can be useful in specific situations, but it's crucial to understand its implications and handle it appropriately throughout the application to avoid unexpected behavior.
